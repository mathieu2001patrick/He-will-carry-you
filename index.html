        Lyrics <br><br>
        There is no problem too big
        God cannot solve it <br>
        There is no mountain too tall <br>
        He cannot move it <br>
        There is no storm too dark <br>
        God cannot calm it <br>
        There is no sorrow too deep <br>
        He cannot soothe it <br>
        If He carried the weight of the world, <br>
        upon His shoulders <br>
        I know, my brother, <br>
        that He will carry you <br>
        If He carried the weight of the world, <br>
         upon His shoulders <br>
        I know, my sister, that He will carry you <br>
        He said, "Come unto me, all who are weary, <br>
        There is no problem too big <br>
        But God cannot solve it <br>
        There is no mountain too tall <br>
        He cannot move it <br>
        There is no storm too dark <br>
        God cannot calm it <br>
        There is no sorrow too deep <br>
        He cannot soothe it <br>
        If He carried the weight of the world, upon His shoulders <br>
        I know, my brother, that He will carry you <br>
        If He carried the weight of the world, upon His shoulders <br>
        I know, my sister, that He will carry you <br>
        If He carried the weight of the world, upon His shoulders <br>
        I know, my brother, that He will carry you <br>
        If He carried the weight of the world, upon His shoulders <br>
        I know, my sister, that He will carry you <br>
        He will carry you, He will carry you
